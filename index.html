    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
      HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used in creating web
      pages and applications. HTML is the standard language used for creating
      web pages and is the backbone of the internet. HTML code is used to create
      the structure and content of a web page. It uses a set of tags to describe
      the structure of texts, images and other content. These tags are used to
      define headings, paragraphs, links, lists, tables, forms, and other
      elements that make up a web page. HTML is a simple language to learn andis
      widely used in web development. It can be used in conjuction with other
      languages such as CSS and JavaScript to create interactive and dynamic web
      pages.

    <h2 id="section-css">CSS</h2>
    <p>
      CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a sheet language used to describe the
      presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It is used to style and
      layout web pages, including elements such as colors, fonts, spacing, and
      more. CSS allows web developers to seperate the presentation of a web page
      from its structure and content. This seperation allows easier maintenance
      and updating of web pages, as changes to the styling can be mad e in one
      central location without affecting the underlying HTML. CSS works by
      applying sytle to HTML elements using selectors. Selectors can target
      specific elements or groups of elements based on attributes, classes or
      IDs. Once a selector has been defined, a set of styles rules can be
      applied to it, specifying things like font size, color, background color,
      and more. There are several ways to adding CSS to an HTML document,
      including in-lines sytles, embedded sytlesheets, and external sytlesheets.
      In-line styles are applied directly to individual HTML elemnets using the
      "Sytle" attribute. Embedded sytlesheets are placed whithin the head
      section of an HTML document using the "Style" tag. External stylesheets
      are stored in seperate CSS files and linked to the HTML document using the
      "link" tag.

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript is a programming laguage that is widely used to create dynamic,
      interactive websites and web applications. It is a high level, interpreted
      language that can be executed in a web browser or on a server using
      Node.js. JavaScript is often used to add functionality to HTMl and CSS,
      allowing web developers to create more engaging and responsive user
      interfaces. It can be used for a variety of tasks, including client-side
      validation, form handling, animations, and AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript
      and XML)requests. Some of the key features of JavaScript include: Dynamic
      typing: Variables in JavaScriptdo not have a fixed type, and their type
      can change dynamically at run time. Objects and prototypes: JavaScript is
      an object-oriented language that uses prototypes to inherit properties and
      methods from other objects. Closures: Functions in JavaScript can be used
      to create closures, which allow the function to access variables in its
      outer scope even after the outer function has retuned. Callbacks and
      Promises: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming through the use of
      callbacks and Promises, which allow long-running tasks to be executed
      without blacking the main thread. JavaScript has become an essential tool
      for web developers and is widely suppoerted by mordern web browsers. It's
      popularity has alose led to the development of numerous framworks adn
      libraries, such as React, Angular and Vue, which makes it easier to build
      complex applications.JavaScript is a high-level programming language that
      is primarily used to create interactive web pages and web applications. It
      is a scripting language that can be embedded into HTML documents to add
      interactivity and functionality. JavaScript is supported by all modern web
      browsers, which makes it a popular choice for web developers. JavaScript
      was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications in 1995, and it has
      since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the
      world. It is an object-oriented language that supports event-driven
      programming, which allows developers to create dynamic web applications
      that respond to user actions in real-time. JavaScript is often used in
      conjunction with HTML and CSS to create modern, responsive websites and
      web applications. It is also used on the server-side, using frameworks
      like Node.js, to create scalable web applications and APIs. Some of the
      key features of JavaScript include its dynamic typing, which allows
      variables to be assigned different data types at runtime, and its support
      for closures, which allow functions to retain access to their lexical
      environments even after they have finished executing. JavaScript also
      supports asynchronous programming, which allows code to execute in
      parallel without blocking the main thread, making it ideal for creating
      responsive user interfaces.
